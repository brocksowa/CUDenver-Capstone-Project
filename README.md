This project explores customer conversions within banking, focusing on transitions from indirect to converted indirect members in a Credit Union. This research is done to aid banking institutions in enhancing customer relationships and optimizing conversion strategies. Using regression modeling and machine learning, we identify key factors driving conversions. Base logistic regression emerges as optimal for its simplicity and interpretability, informing demographic model utilization. Targeted advertising and promotions are recommended to facilitate conversions. Leveraging demographic data, cost-effective approaches are proposed, emphasizing importance on the variables, AGE_CLASS and STATE_STATUS.
