This research was done as the capstone project required for graduation from the CU Denver Mathematics department. The project required that a small group of students work with a sponsor, in this case a credit union, to analyze actual data and complete a real-world project to gain non-classroom experience.

Specifically, this project explores customer conversions within banking, focusing on transitions from indirect to converted indirect members in a credit union. This research is done to aid banking institutions in enhancing customer relationships and optimizing conversion strategies. Using regression modeling and machine learning, we identify key factors driving conversions. Base logistic regression emerges as optimal for its simplicity and interpretability, informing demographic model utilization. Targeted advertising and promotions are recommended to facilitate conversions. Leveraging demographic data, cost-effective approaches are proposed, emphasizing importance on the variables, AGE_CLASS and STATE_STATUS.

The data that was used is the sole property of the sponsor and so the files cannot be provided in order for replication.
